Introduction
----
This is a derivation of the orignal data set sourced as mentioned above, and linked [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Accelerometer and gyroscope signal data recorded by a smartphone(Samsung Galaxy S II) was collected from 30 subjects performing six different activities. The data was hand labeled. The collected signal data was then filtered, sampled and transformed to produce 561 time and frequency domain variables. This derived data set is only concerned with variables obtained from mean and standard deviation measurements. More information on the specifics of the experiment can be found at the link provided above.
